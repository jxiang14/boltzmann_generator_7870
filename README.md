# boltzmann_generator_7870
An implementation of a Boltzmann Generator (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1147) built as a final project
for CHEM7870. This implementation currently works for the double well potential.
To use this package, run `pip install .` within the repository. To train the Boltzmann Generator,
run `python examples/double_well.py` with the appropriate arguments.
